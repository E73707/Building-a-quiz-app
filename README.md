# Building-a-quiz-app
Multiple Choice Website This JavaScript project is a multiple choice website that allows users to take quizzes and store their scores and names in the local system.

During this project I used information I learned in the last few weeks to build a basic 10 question Coding Quiz. The features of my website included a dynamic Ranking system which would take user names and scores and sort the top 3 users by their scores. A timer which would decrease by 10 seconds whenever a question was answered incorrectly, as well as local storage of user scores and names.

This was the most challenging project to date and i had trouble particularily with the timer aspect. As well as storing information in the local storage

additionally moving forward I will be aiming at selecting class names rather than IDs, wherever possible in order to clean up my existing code. As well as practicing with using the local storage more
